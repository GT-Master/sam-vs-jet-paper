Data processing and analysis
=============================

Introduction
-------------
The scripts contained here do a variety of tasks, such as calculating trends,
properties of the jet and the SAM index. This is often done for various 
time-periods. The outputs are typically saved in HDF5 format, either as Pandas 
DataFrames or numpy arrays. The data created here is what is ultimately used by
the analysis and plotting scripts to produce the paper figures.

All scripts can be run automatically using `run.py`, or each can be run 
individually.
